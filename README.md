# Moire Detection Convolutional Neural Network Project
 An AI project designed to alert the user when moire is detected during a virtual production shoot. The project records an image of the moire allowing the user to check and re-shoot accordingly. Completed as the final submission for CMP511 Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence during MSc Technical Art and VFX at Abertay University, Dundee.
This CNN is trained on the dataset found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/uhdm-dataset
